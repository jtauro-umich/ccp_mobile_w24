            <div class="headerItem"><h2>Baking Adventures</h2></div>
						<div class="headerItem"><p>I also enjoy dabbling in baking and cake decoration. My foccacia-baking and quiche/pie skills are (obviously) better than my cake decoration. Check out my favorite foccacia recipe at this link: <a href= "https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-no-knead-focaccia">Bon Appetit's Foccacia</a>.<p></div>

						<div class="headerItem"><h2>Basics: Rice</h2></div>
            <div class="headerItem"><p>If you are very new to cooking, like I was just last year, even the smallest things can seem quite challenging. I always reccomend finding a good recipie and following it. If you can ask a friend questions, even better! My favorite go-to place for recipies is my mom's cookign channel on YouTube! Here is the link to her <a href = "https://youtu.be/UzfZlB8peu8?si=jw0JoD1jsh34zrKk">Jeera Rice Recipie</a>. This is one of my most re-watched YouTube videos. I have also added the recipie below!</p></div>
						<div class="smallerItem"><h3>Jeera Rice Ingredients</h3></div>
            <div class="smallerItem1"><h3>Directions:</h3></div>
						
						
						<div class="smallerItem"><ul>
                <li>2 cups   	Basmati rice</li>
                <li>1 tbsp.   vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp.   jeera (cumin seeds)</li>
								<li>4 cups		water</li>
								<li>1.5-2 tbsp.  preserved lemons, diced finely</li>
            </ul></div>

						
						<div class="smallerItem1"><ul class="list">
							<ol>1. Pour the rice in a colander and wash thoroughly for about 30 seconds to remove as much starch as possible.  Drain.</ol>
							<ol>2. Heat a medium pot on high.  Add oil and jeera.  Fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.</ol>
							<ol>3. Add the rice and fry for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</ol>
