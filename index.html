		    <p>My name is Julia and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan (Graduation: April 2026). I've been interested in web design ever since my first HTML coding experience in 5th grade, when I made a website about my favorit color: purple!</p>
            <p>I am not a big pet-person (partially due to my mild fur allergy), but my favorite dog in the whole workd is Ace Kumar. I enjoy cooking, and I have a long list of recipies that I have already or are planning to recreate! Travel has never been a huge hobby of mine, but I have recently had some fun trips to India, New York City and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico!</p>
            <p>You can find me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-tauro/">LinkedIn</a> or contact me at <a href = "mailto:john@example.co">jtauro@umich.edu</a>.</p>
